## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to style the color of ordered and unordered list styles such as bullets and numbers.

```css
li::marker {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_bullet_color.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_bullet_color.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to chane the color of list style such as bullet and number. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
